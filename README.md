# Timhorton-s-Order-Page
Designed a dynamic web app, manipulating its HTML DOM using client-side programming languages JavaScript and PHP. This page asks for the user's coffee order. Inputs have constraints to be followed. If an order is successful it will land users on a page showing users orders through images and calculates the total cost of the order.
